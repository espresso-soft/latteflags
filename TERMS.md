<h2 align="center">Safety Warning</h2>

> FastFlags are extremely powerful, being that they are intended to only be used by Roblox engineers. While they can be very useful, they can cause issues with stability and functionality if you don't know what you're doing.
> 
> You should only use the flag list editor if you know what you're doing. You should only configure flags of which you fully know what they do.
> 
> We especially do not recommend importing any large lists of flags, for all the reasons stated above. If you're encountering any issues with Roblox, your first action should be to remove anything you've manually configured in the editor.
